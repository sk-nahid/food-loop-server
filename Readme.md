## üîê Authentication

This backend uses **Firebase Admin SDK** for authentication.
To access protected routes:

1. The client must obtain a Firebase ID token after logging in.
2. Send the token in the `Authorization` header as:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your_firebase_token>
   ```
3. The backend verifies the token before allowing access.

If you want, I can also add a **Postman API collection** for this backend so developers can test the routes instantly without manual setup.  
That would make your project even more professional.
